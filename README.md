**main goal:** To learn the process of building react website. No creativity here.

**process:** Strictly followed the tutorial with slight changes.

**sources used help understanding:** [_Original tutorial link_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlROncAX4XI&t=1416s) , stackOverflow.

**what have I done differently with the tutorial?**

I haven't do much differently in this practice, mostly followed the tutorial.

- expanded product items from 3 to 6 with grid-template-column;
- added ipad compalibility with @media


**what have I learned building Website React?**?

- create-react-app and setup from scratch.
- how to use Import and Export to get and give components. 
- cause of missing erros of 'styled-components' ,'react-router-dom' 'react-icons' and how to install them.
- basic structure of building react website. i.e. build each part of website seperatly, then combind them together. So the entire structure is easy to understand and easy to maintain.
